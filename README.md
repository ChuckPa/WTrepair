WTcleaner

This package performs its cleanup of broken WebTools packages (pre DSM 6.0 update 3 release)

After installing this package,  uninstall it and WebTools normally via Package Center.

If both still persist / give errors,  DSM has faulted internally and is beyond the capability of this package to repair.  You must unfortunately perform a Synology-standard DSM reinstallation after saving your DSM configuration (Control Panel - Update/Restore - Backup configuration)
